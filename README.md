## 🤖 AI Tools Used in Development

This project was proudly **AI-assisted**, showcasing how developers can use artificial intelligence in real-life workflows. Tools used:

| Tool       | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ChatGPT    | Component logic, responsive fixes, and design improvement ideas         |
| Emergent   | Generated initial layout structure and section suggestions              |
| DeepSeek   | Debugging UI issues and alternate implementation suggestions            |
| Grok       | Provided creative solutions and bug-fixes for edge cases                |

> ⚠️ All logic decisions, structural planning, customizations, and final implementation were handled by me. These tools served as intelligent assistants, not substitutes.
